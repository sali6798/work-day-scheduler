# work-day-scheduler

## Description
A scheduler that helps plan out the work day. An event can be added and saved, and even if the page is left, the schedule will still be there. Or if the whole schedule needs to be cleared, the 'Clear Schedule' button at the bottom of the page will take care of that. The scheduler makes it easy to see what time it is by highlighting past hours, the current hour, and future hours in different colors. These colors will continue to update throughout the work day, without the need to refresh, on the hour, so the current hour and whatever event is on will always be easy to see at a glance. At the start of a new day (midnight), the past day's schedule will be cleared and the date at the top updated, to be ready for a new working day.
